# Chameleon Scope / r2d

This repository contains all the code (microcontroller, flutter-app, open scad) that was written during the lecture "Agile Softwareentwicklung" (agile software development) in the summer semester 2023. 

Originally the repository was only for the r2d-part of the project but later was used by both teams.

If you are interested in the project, you can find the final code in the new repository https://github.com/arhe42/Chameleon-Scope. There is also a tutorial how to set up the whole Chameleon Scope smart glasses if u want to use the product.
